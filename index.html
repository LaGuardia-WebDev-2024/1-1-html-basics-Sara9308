  <h1>Misty</h1>
  <h3>By Ella Fitzgerald</h3>
  <p>Look at me,<br>Im as helpless as a kitten up a tree<br> And i feel like im clining to a cloud<br>I can't understand,<br>I get misty just holding your hand<br>Walk my way,<br>And a thousand violins begin to play<br>Or it might be the sound of you're hello<br>That music i hear,<br>I get misty the moment you're near</p>
  <p>Can't you see that you're leading me on,<br> But it's just what i want you to do<br>Don't you notice how hoplessly im lost,<br>That's why im following you </p>
